## About ##
This is an implementation of Gothic's [Daedalus](http://www.worldofgothic.de/modifikation/index.php?go=daedalus) language. I attempt to achieve 100% source level compatibility with the original implementions.

I started project mostly for fun, this project has no practical purpose (unless somebody decides to make start FreeGothic project).

Project is currently abandoned in favor of [hrscript](https://github.com/absurdworlds/hrscript). 

## Language description ##
See [this page](http://www.worldofgothic.de/modifikation/index.php?go=daedalus).
