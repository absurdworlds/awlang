## About ##
This is an implementation of Gothic's [Daedalus](http://www.worldofgothic.de/modifikation/index.php?go=daedalus) language. I attempt to achieve 100% source level compatibility with the original implementions.

This implementation is based on LLVM compiler infrastructure, which I use for JIT code generation.

I started project mostly for fun, this project has no practical purpose (unless somebody decides to make start FreeGothic project).
## Language description ##
