## About ##
This is an implementation of Gothic's [Daedalus](http://www.worldofgothic.de/modifikation/index.php?go=daedalus) language. I attempt to achieve 100% source level compatibility between my and the original implementtions. This implementation is based on LLVM compiler infrastructure, which I use for JIT code generation.

I started this project mostly for fun, and also to develop a skeleton for hrscript project.
